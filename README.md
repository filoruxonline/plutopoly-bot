# Plutopoly Bot
*This is an early version that hasn't been fully tested. Many things are subject to change*
## Template
All game data can be changed and listened to via a REST API (from Google FireStore).\
This is a template that handles all of that for you. It has an easy to use API that is not hard to learn.
You can start in your brower via [repl.it](#Repl.it).
# Prerequisites
## Basic programming
You need to know variables and data types, functions, ... The basics will do. If you already know a language you have a great headstart.
## Dart
This project uses the programming language Dart. I recommend going through [the dart language tour](https://dart.dev/guides/language/language-tour) to learn the syntax. 
The most import things are:
1. Everything is an object, even functions
2. Dart is strongly typed (You should define the type when creating a variable) [generics](https://dart.dev/guides/language/language-tour#generics)
2. Lists, maps, ... 
3. Functions: (named) parameters
4. Lexical scope (encapsulation) *not as hard as it sounds*
5. Basic operations, flow
6. Classes: methods, fields and static will do for simple projects\n*This project has a lot of static methods*

You don't have to know everything by hearth to get started. You can always check to page.

## Repl.it
If you know the above, the easiest way to get started is using [repl.it](repl.it).
Create an account and go to new repl. Select import from github and paste this url: `https://github.com/filoruxonline/plutopoly-bot`
> If you have a top right screen where you have to select a language and configure the run button. You have to select dart and type as run command\n
> dart main.dart

You probably have the .packages file open but select the main.dart file and follow the comments.
